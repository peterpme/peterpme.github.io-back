After using Apollo for the last few months, Iâ€™ve picked up some great patterns weâ€™ve adopted at [Orchard](https://www.orchard.ai), where weâ€™ve re-implemented an experience for our beta testers just about every week

> The faster we can build something, the sooner we can get feedback from our beta testers and the better chance we have of building an amazing product.

#### **Folder Structure:**

I donâ€™t inline my queries. Maybe Iâ€™m cray cray, but I strongly believe in being able to search and reuse something as quickly as possible. [ag](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher), [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf), [Alfred Workflows](https://www.alfredapp.com/workflows/) and [Nuclide search](https://nuclide.io/docs/features/quick-open/#code-search) are my best friends IRL. I try to be as descriptive as possible, even if that means a 40 character filename.

#### Hereâ€™s what that folder structure looksÂ like:

```
/containers
/components
/utilities
/modals
/graphql
/queries
/mutations
```

I typically like to keep my folder structure flat. Iâ€™m ok with nesting GraphQL because Iâ€™ve realized over time that I can figure out if something is a query or a mutation without appending `mutation` or `query` to the end of the file.

#### Naming Conventions:

Mutations will always start with an action:

- `saveUserPushToken`
- `updateOnboardingProfile`
- `createUser`

Queries just describe what Iâ€™m looking for:

- `userProfile`
- `userConnections`
- `reminders`

Sometimes theyâ€™ll even look like this:

- `remindersWithNewFeatureOfSomeKind`
- `userProfileWithUserSettings`
- `userPrioritiesWithRemindersAtTheTop`

I donâ€™t prefix them with anything because I already know they live under the `queries` folder no matter what I do. Besides, prefixing them with something like `get` may make it seem like an API action. Also, I tried it and didnâ€™t like it.

#### File Structure:

I donâ€™t like to keep them in the same file either because I literally spend more time scrolling than I do typing! What does each file look like? The way youâ€™d expect:

```javascript
import gql from "graphql-tag";

const updateUsername = gql`
  mutation UpdateUsername($id: ID!, $username: String!) {
    updateUsername(id: $id, username: $username) {
      id
    }
  }
`;

export default updateUsername;
```

`updateUserProfile` will have its own file too!

This way no matter what, I can continue to move quickly, implement our new features from design and have an exact description of what each and every file is doing.

### Final Thoughts

Iâ€™ve fallen in love with this setup for my queries and mutations. Iâ€™ve rewritten our mutations and queries ~50 times and havenâ€™t like Iâ€™ve been going against the grain yet.

That being said, this folder / file structure is not for everyone. Consult with your manager and co-worker and make sure that this folder structure is right for you.

Side effects include yelling at me online so donâ€™t yell at me!

If you have a better way, Iâ€™m always open to new ideas: [Hit me up on Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/peterpme)
