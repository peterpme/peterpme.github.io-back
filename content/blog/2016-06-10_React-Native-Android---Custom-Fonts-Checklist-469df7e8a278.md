Here are a few things to remember:

- file type needs to be `ttf` NOT OTF!
- Create `assets/fonts` if it doesnâ€™t exist (mkdir -p assets/fonts)
- place the font files within `./android/app/src/main/assets/fonts/FONT_NAME.ttf`
- Recompile. `react-native run-android`
- `fontFamily: FONT_NAME (1:1)`
- Viola!
