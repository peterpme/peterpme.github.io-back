I started with Vim long before Atom was a thing and have always liked it, despite the obvious drawbacks.</p>\n<p>Even when I switched to Atom, I found myself longing for the keyboard shortcuts and presets that keep me feeling young.</p>\n<p>Vim isn’t for everyone, especially if you’ve started with a modern text editor like Atom (Vi came out in 76, Vim came out in 91, it’s old AF).</p>\n<p>That being said, I’d like to help you address your issues. In terms of syntax highlighting, there’s something called Tigris that can help you get there. It’s a little buggy though -> <a href=\"https://github.com/billyvg/tigris.nvim\">https://github.com/billyvg/tigris.nvim</a></p>\n<p>I’m assuming you’re talking about vertical line-spacing. You’ll have to control that through iTerm.</p>\n<p>Ale will let you set your own characters if you’re not a fan of “>>”. You can switch it to the • character if that makes it more pleasing.</p>\n<p>I’m not quite sure what you mean by the tildes in your setup but check out mine here and see if mine looks different: <a href=\"https://github.com/peterpme/dotfiles/tree/master/config/nvim\">https://github.com/peterpme/dotfiles/tree/master/config/nvim</a></p>\n<p>Thanks for your thoughtful post! Hopefully some of my answers will help you get to where you want to be :)</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Hey,","date":"April 03, 2017","description":"Vim is far from perfect, you’re right about that!
